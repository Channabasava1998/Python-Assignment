    "    \n",
    "1.Numeric : numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "INTEGER: is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). Ex. 22,56\n",
    "\n",
    "FLOAT: is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Ex. 56.3\n",
    "\n",
    "COMPLEX: is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. Ex. 5+6j\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Sequence Type: is the ordered collection of similar or different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "String:is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. Ex. 'Channu'\n",
    "\n",
    "List:is an ordered collection of data which is changeable, and allow duplicate values. list is written in square bracket Ex. l=[1,5,6,4,8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple:is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. in tiple we use curve bracket  Ex. t=(1,2,3,4,5,2,6)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Dictionary: is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’. Ex. Dict = {'Name': 'Geeks', 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]} "

    "Answer:\n",

    "1. Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n",

    "3. Integral Expressions: These are the kind of expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
    "6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False. It basically specifies one or more conditions.\n"
